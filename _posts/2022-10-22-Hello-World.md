# Welcome

Hello world, this is my first blog on a site I created mostly myself. Greetz to Jekyll site generator for quick deployment, Github pages for a place to host this, Google domains for cool vanity TLDs, and [nrandecker](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle) for the inspo on the sweet particles effect on my landing page.

At the moment, this site is still under construction and is prone to unnecessary features, bugs, catastrophic security vulnerabilities, and web design faux pas. 

The goal of this blog is to attempt organizing my ramblings between vulnerability research/exploit development and outdoor adventures.
